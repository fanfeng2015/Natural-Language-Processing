        "\n",
        "Cześć! Hello! Bonjour! In this assignment we are going to build a machine learning model for translating from one language to another using PyTorch. We will be working with German to English translation, but the methods and implementation generalize to any language for which there exists an equivalent tokenizer. Also, the sequence-to-sequence models which will be introduced are used in tasks beyond translation, including summarization, dialogue systems, among others. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) models were first introduced in the [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) paper. These models do exactly what you'd think they do; they take one sequence and output another sequence (see [this link](http://jalammar.github.io/images/seq2seq_2.mp4)). Seq2seq models are a type of **encoder-decoder** model, in which a  model such as *recurrent neural network* (RNN) *encodes* the input (also called source) sentence into a single vector, often called the context vector. The context vector is a representation of the entire input sentence, and this vector is then *decoded* by a second model, often another RNN, which learns to output the *target* sentence by generating one word at a time. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/master/assets/seq2seq1.png\" alt=\"mlp\" align=\"middle\"></center>\n",
        "\n",
        "This image shows an example translation using recurrent neural networks. The source sentence, \"guten morgen\" is input into the encoder (green) one word at a time. We also append a *start of sequence* (`<sos>`) and *end of sequence* (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively, to give the model an idea of when encoding and decoding start and end. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the current word, $x_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. You can think of the hidden state as a vector representation of the sentence so far. The RNN can be represented as a function of both of $x_t$ and $h_{t-1}$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$h_t = \\text{EncoderRNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "We're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an *LSTM* (Long Short-Term Memory) or a *GRU* (Gated Recurrent Unit). Additionally, as we will later see, there are non-recurrent models which achieve state-of-the-art results for machine translation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we have $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\\}$, where $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually initialized to zeros.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$. This is a vector representation of the entire source sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have our context vector, $z$, we can start decoding it to get the target sentence, \"good morning.\" Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens to the target sentence. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the current word, $y_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$, i.e. the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. Thus, similar to the encoder, we can represent the decoder as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$s_t = \\text{DecoderRNN}(y_t, s_{t-1})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "In the decoder, we need to go from the hidden state to an actual word, therefore at each time-step we use $s_t$ to predict (by passing it through a `Linear` layer, shown in purple which projects the hidden state onto the output vocabulary space, to which softmax is applied to pick the most likely word) what we think is the next word in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_t$. \n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\hat{y}_t = f(s_t)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "We always use `<sos>` for the first input to the decoder, $y_1$, but for subsequent inputs, $y_{t>1}$, we will sometimes use the actual, ground truth next word in the sequence, $y_t$ and sometimes use the word predicted by our decoder, $\\hat{y}_{t-1}$. This is called *teacher forcing*, and you can read about it more [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/).\n",
        "\n",
        "When training/testing our model, we always know how many words are in our target sentence, so we stop generating words once we hit that many. During inference (i.e. real world usage where we do not have access to the target translations) it is common to keep generating words until the model outputs an `<eos>` token or after a certain amount of words have been generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have our predicted target sentence, $\\hat{Y} = \\{ \\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, ..., \\hat{y}_T \\}$, we compare it against our actual target sentence, $Y = \\{ y_1, y_2, ..., y_T \\}$, to calculate our loss. We then use this loss to update all of the parameters in our model.\n"
